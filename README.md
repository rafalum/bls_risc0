# BLS Public Key Aggregation in RiscZero

This is a little toy example to prove that we know `n` BLS public keys that result in a specific aggregated key.

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup] is installed. The
[`rust-toolchain.toml`][rust-toolchain] file will be used by `cargo` to
automatically install the correct version.

To build all methods and execute the method within the zkVM, run the following
command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This is an empty template, and so there is no expected output (until you modify
the code).

### Executing the project locally in development mode

During development, faster iteration upon code changes can be achieved by leveraging [dev-mode], we strongly suggest activating it during your early development phase. Furthermore, you might want to get insights into the execution statistics of your project, and this can be achieved by specifying the environment variable `RUST_LOG="[executor]=info"` before running your project.

Put together, the command to run your project in development mode while getting execution statistics is:

```bash
RUST_LOG="[executor]=info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```

## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications, which we think is a good starting point for your applications.

```text
project_name
├── Cargo.toml
├── host
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs                    <-- [Host code goes here]
└── methods
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── build.rs
    ├── guest
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── method_name.rs         <-- [Guest code goes here]
    └── src
        └── lib.rs
```
